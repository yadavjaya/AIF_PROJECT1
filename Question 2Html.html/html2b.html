                    <td>An heirloom favorite of many growers, the St. Valery carrot originated in France and has since been brought to gardens across the world. Each reddish-orange carrot is large and tapering in shape, reaching about 10–12″ in length with 2–3″ diameter tops.</td>
                    <td>Purple Haze has a purple exterior and orange interior. Circles of cut Purple Haze carrots have two distinct colors: a halo of purple with a bright orange center. The best appearance of Purple Haze will be raw in salads or cole slaw. When cooked in water, the purple color will fade.</td>
                    <td>These very dark purple coloured carrots have a lovely sweet flavour. Unlike 'Cosmic Purple', this variety retains its deep colour all the way through to the core. The plants are very vigorous with tall, strong tops.</td>
                    <td>A creamy white carrot with green shoulders, Lunar White is mild and sweet. The tender roots grow to 6-8”. White carrots are making a comeback. When Henry VIII sat down for lunch, the carrots on the table were white. </td>

Carrots have calcium and vitamin K, both of which are important for bone health.
                       Carrot are root vegetables that were first grown in Afghanistan around 900 AD. Orange may be their best-known color, but they also come in other hues, including purple, yellow, red, and white. Early carrots were purple or yellow. Orange carrots were developed in Central Europe around the 15th or 16th century.
                       This popular and versatile veggie may taste slightly different depending on the color, size, and where it's grown. The sugar in carrots gives them a slightly sweet flavor, but they also can taste earthy or bitter.

            <p>Garden-grown carrots are full of flavor and texture! They are a popular, long-lasting root vegetable that can be grown in many climates.
              Learn all about planting, growing, and harvesting carrots.
              Carrots are easy to grow as long as they are planted in loose, sandy soil during the cooler 
              periods of the growing season—spring and fall (carrots can tolerate frost). 
              Depending on the variety and local growing conditions, carrots may take anywhere from 2 to 4 months to mature. 
              Plant them in the spring and summer for a continuous harvest through fall!</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Gently mulch carrots to retain moisture, speed germination, and block the sun from hitting the roots directly.</li>
                  <li>When seedlings are an inch tall, thin so that they stand 3 to 4 inches apart. Snip tops with scissors instead of pulling them out to prevent damage to the fragile roots of the remaining plants.</li>
                  <li>Water at least one inch (about 1/2 gallon per square foot) per week to start, then two inches as roots mature.</li>
                  <li>Weed diligently, but be careful not to disturb the young carrots’ roots while doing so.</li>
                  <li>Fertilize with a low-nitogen but high-potassium and -phosphate fertilizer 5 to 6 weeks after sowing.</li>
              </ul>
